# Unclutter IG
*Xposed module for Instagram*

Remove the clutter from your IG experience -- this Xposed module hides advertisements and promoted content from your Instagram feed and stories.
Also has bonus option to clean up the Explore (search) page; choose to stop showing all those suggested posts from public accounts.
&nbsp;  
Note: Beyond the standard ads, 'paid partnership' branded content refers to any posts from accounts you follow which are officially labeled by Instagram with company branding.  They're subtitled as 'Paid partnership with **[company]**'.  
&nbsp;  
This module automates the process of intercepting and hiding the unwanted content, and shouldn't rely on specific IG versions to function properly.  
However, if newer IG versions begin to break functionality, module updates should hopefully follow soon to keep up with the changes.  
&nbsp;  
As of 08/03/2019, confirmed to support latest release **104.0.0.21.118**.
