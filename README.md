# Unclutter IG
*Xposed module for Instagram*

Remove the clutter from your IG experience -- this Xposed module hides advertisements and promoted content from your Instagram feed and stories.
Also has bonus option to keep the search (Explore) page from showing suggested posts.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Note: Beyond the standard ads, 'paid partnership' branded content refers to any posts from accounts you follow which are officially labeled with company branding: eg. 'Paid partnership with **company_xyz**' is present in the subtitle.

This module automates the detection of certain classes, methods, & fields in order to intercept and hide unwanted content, and therefore is designed to avoid relying on a particular IG version to function properly.  
&nbsp;  
Developed and tested using several IG versions between 75.0.0.23.99 and 94.0.0.22.116.  
As of 07/12/2019, confirmed to support latest release 101.0.0.15.120.
